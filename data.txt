Story about class .
I've worked with one of language institutes in Pune, Maharashtra for gaining experience.
My sister used to learn German but had to leave the class due to unadjustable timings of her job and then I realised, an individual could attend the class only if he/she has time .But what about people who want to learn and are passionate about learning but can't attend the class due to work ? 
And then suddenly Covid situation had spread everywhere .It would be little selfish of me to say that it helped me work on this issue ,but it definitely proved beneficial for me ( to maximize my knowledge ) as well as for learners ( to learn language from their very comfortable space) .


Philosophy 
Teaching students according to how they wanna learn.
The only way to make learners understand what they are learning is by teaching them in a manner they understand .Only then it is possible to make one understand the beauty of language .  


Approach 
My approach is completely on practical and interactive teaching. 
For eg- knowing the rules of grammar is not enough ,but why those rules are made is something worth  . Encouraging learners to ask more questions and answering those queries in easiest , understandable and acceptable manner is beyond perfection.


Intro about you
Hey ! I'm Shweta and I've been learning German since past 3 years and trust me I had no intention of joining the class .I just wanted to do something apart from my regular curriculum.
But once I dived into it ,this language earned my heart and soul forever .I never thought that I would fall for art being a commerce student . I guess opposites attract !! 
I learnt from the best teachers who taught me the language in depth. They cleared all my queries with patience and this helped me understand the language.
I've been teaching German for the last 1 year and I love teaching with all my heart . As its said knowledge increases only by giving and I am greedy about it. I want to expand my knowledge and teach with passion.
